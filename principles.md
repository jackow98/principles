# Principles

## Summary

The concept of principles is based on that of Ray Dalio. After reading his book, [Principles](https://www.principles.com/), I started to really connect with the concept of radical open-mindedness. It complemented the idea of Growth Mindsets and Optimism which I first discovered in my sixth year of high school. Open-mindedness changed my life and continues to do so today. Recently, I have been attending psychotherapy to increase my self-awareness, tackle issues from my past and recognise my strengths.

> Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life.

I have laid out my principles in life to allow myself to better understand the decisions I make in day to day life. I aim to continue to update the entire document over time as I learn and further develop myself.

### Self

- **To succeed, we must first know who we are and who we want to be, then, become that person**
    1. Knowing what we believe in is one step in living a fulfilled life, ensuring our actions and way of thinking match our beliefs is another step that requires self reflection and practice
    2. It is common for us to confuse what we want out of life with what others want us to be
- **We can’t succeed as individuals**
    1. We have a duty in this world to act as a community and help each other
    2. Waiting for happiness to come to us is not an efficient approach in life
    3. We all have a responsibility to give back to the earth
    4. It is easier to abstract from responsibilities than to accept them however this is not an optimal approach
    5. Random and meaningful acts of kindness go a long way
    6. Self-awareness is not a journey that can be undertaken alone, it requires the help of believable others
    7. We should stop contemplating how people might perceive our decisions and start finding out how they actually perceive them
    8. It is better to consult believable others than to struggle alone
- **We must be open minded**
    1. Welcoming, seeking and acting on feedback in all walks of life is essential for success
    2. New ideas should be embraced and considered
    3. Debating all angles of an argument is crucial in understanding it and assessing its value
    4. We all have our own opinions that we have developed over time and need to be open to debating these openly to ensure they are an accurate representation of our principles
    5. People are humans - we quite often alienate others and forgot that strangers are humans just like us
    6. Just because you don't understand something does not make it wrong
- **Mistakes are beneficial as long as they are turned into lessons to rectify them**
    1. We should be open about our weaknesses and mistakes to allow ourselves and others to recognise, mitigate and learn from them
    2. Our actions are not all a direct consequence of our logical self
    3. Everyone makes mistakes on a daily basis
    4. Trying and failing can be difficult however it is better than not trying at all
    5. We do not need to remove all of our weaknesses but should work to reduce their negative effects on our life
    6. We should strive to fight our lazy, appetite driven lower level self that contradicts our goals in life
    7. We get easily swayed and don't always make decisions with adequate or correct information
    8. We should value our approach to rectifying the wrong more than our starting point
- **If we can't complete a task effectively, have a break and come back to it**
    1. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast

### Education

- **Everyone has the capability to learn with the right tools and help**
    1. Prior exposure to content and quality of education both affects our ability to learn collectively and enhances it
    2. When learning something new, we continuously try different approaches to learn and seek variations in content until we are able to align the new concept with our existing knowledge
    3. Everyone deserves an equal opportunity to learn; this does not mean each individual requires the same tools to learn
    4. Learning is either 1) Connecting someone else's learning to your own knowledge and beliefs or 2) Connecting the objective reality of nature to your own knowledge and beliefs

### Life

- **We should appreciate the little things in life**
    1. Perfection doesn’t exist, life is like a piece of music full of ups and downs. By regularly taking time to be with those we love and look at the beauty of the world around us, we can better appreciate the life we have
    2. If you are with another person you value, you should be in the moment with them
- **We are not irreplaceable**
    1. We must be able to objectively decide if a person is the right fit for the task at hand
    2. Knowing when to delegate and when to self assign is vital in managing a project
    3. There is a limit to the amount of projects one person can take on; this limit varies depending on the amount of effective delegation
- **Experience of life influences our principles**
    1. We can change how we act
    2. We should always be refining our principles
    3. There is a difference between constantly dropping principles and refining them over time
    4. We are creatures of habit and habits need to be practised and ingrained into us
    5. As we learn through education, reading, self-reflection, friends and colleagues, we can make more informed decisions that form our opinions
    6. We are constructivists - when we are learning a new concept, we draw on our current knowledge to help us understand the new information
- **Everything can be used for good and bad**
    1. Everything and everyone has the potential to cause damage
    2. Training and awareness with open-mindedness are essential in ensuring the best outcomes
    3. It’s easier to ignore, lie and pretend than to act
    4. Everybody has good and bad within them and can be educated to promote goodness
    5. Rehabilitation should be chosen over neglect
    6. All decisions will pose, at first glance, a risky option and an easy option. Upon closer inspection both have the potential to offer good and bad. It is up to us to realistically weigh up the positive and negative effects of both.

### Technology

- **Technology will continue to shape our future**
    1. Technology is evolving humans
    2. Technology should be used as an aid to make the world a better place
    3. Creativity and emotion are what define us as humans
    4. Technology should not be used to replace meaningful memories but instead as a way of capturing them
    5. We are scared of innovation and need better education on new tools being developed
    6. We should educate children about technology from a young age so they can better understand the world they will grow up in
    7. New technologies can’t be stopped, innovation drives us so the safest approach is to monitor the laws and control the individuals who drive this innovation
    8. Just because technology doesn’t exist yet doesn’t mean that it can’t or won’t
